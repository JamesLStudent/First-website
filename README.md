## Explanation

This project is written by a teacher as a bare-bones
example website to teach me git and cli , with tweaks 
made here and there to the CSS by myself.
It's built using HTML and CSS, with links to wikipedia 
and images taken from Google. 

I'd say the project, such as it is, is finished, as
there's nothing more I'd like to add.
